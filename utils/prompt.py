Generate image executing code based on the given image, and description text using python.

* Since we will execute the code in a Jupyter environment, you must to use `image.show()` to display the image at the end fo the code.
* **DON'T SAVE THE IMAGE TO A  FILE**, just display it.
* If you are using opencv to process image, you must turn the processed image into PIL format and show it, instead of show it using opencv directly.

1. Be executed in a Jupyter environment
2. Display the result using `image.show()` at the end

- Image Path: "{{ image_path }}"
- Image Size: {{ image_size }}

Code Requirements:
a) Begin by loading the image
b) Implement the specified operation with condition-based logic
c) If using OpenCV:
   - Convert BGRâ†’RGB before PIL conversion
   - Use `Image.fromarray(cv2_image_rgb)`
d) Final line must be: `processed_image.show()`"""
